# All-Resolutions Inference Project

All-Resolutions Inference is a new statistical framework for the analysis of functional MRI data. The framework is based on closed testing methodology and allow users to analyse statistical brain maps from functional (and structural) MRI studies with unprecendented flexibility. There are already many implementations and improvements since the original paper (ref) and this page aims to provide an overview of the latest status of these methods and give background information on the methodology. If you are new to the method, please read the [background] information. If you are ready to start analysing your data go the [implementation] section. For questions, reach out to [w].[d].[weeda]\@[fsw].[leidenuniv].[nl].

This page is work in progress...
